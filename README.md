# Ever wonder how bad a IIDX controller could be?
Well, this definitely isn't the WORST, but it sure isn't too great either. I made this out of boredom during covid-19 quarantine, and used it to teach myself to use autodesk fusion 360. 

Using only parts I had on hand, including a pair of 3D printers (and filament), random chinese microswitches, an encoder stolen from another game controller, and 2 packs of BIC Mechanical pencils (for their springs) I managed to spin straw into gold on this one. Or at least, filament into a controller, I suppose.

Each button is made by putting two pencil springs into the holes on the button pad. Zip tie a microswitch to each post with holes to accomidate one. I'll be uploading pictures to demonstrate all this at some point.
